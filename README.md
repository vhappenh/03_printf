# ft_printf

"ft_printf" is a C programming project focused on recreating the functionality of the printf() function. 
The main objective is to learn about using a variable number of arguments in C. 
The project introduces students to variadic functions and aims for a well-structured and extensible code. 
Once completed, the custom ft_printf() function can be integrated into the student's libft library for use in other school C projects. 
The project follows common instructions such as adherence to the Norm, proper memory management, and Makefile requirements.
